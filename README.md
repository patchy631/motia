Motia is a **modern backend framework** that unifies APIs, background jobs, events, and AI agents into a single cohesive system. A unified backend where **JavaScript, TypeScript, Python, etc**, work together.

### 🧱 The Step Philosophy

- **🎯 Your Logic, Your Step**: A Step holds your business logic. It can be a simple function, a call to a database, or a complex AI agent. This is where your application's real work gets done.
- **🌍 Any Language, One Workflow**: Write Steps in TypeScript, Python, and other languages to come. all in the same project. Use Python for your AI agents and TypeScript for your API, and Motia makes them work together effortlessly.
- **⚡ Full Power, No Boilerplate**: Inside a Step's `handler`, you have the full power of the Node.js or Python ecosystem. Install any package, call any API, connect to any database. No restrictions, just your code.
- **👁️ Zero-Config Observability**: Get full end-to-end tracing and logging for every Step execution, automatically. No setup required. See exactly what happened, when, and why.
- **🌊 Simple & Powerful Workflows**: Connect Steps together by emitting and subscribing to events. Build complex, multi-stage processes with simple, declarative code.
- **🏪 Unified State**: Share data between Steps effortlessly. Motia provides built-in state management that is automatically traced, giving you a complete picture of your data's lifecycle through a workflow.

## 🚧 The Problem

Backend teams juggle **fragmented runtimes** across APIs, background queues, and AI agents. This creates deployment complexity, debugging gaps, and cognitive overhead from context-switching between frameworks.

**This fragmentation demands a unified system.**

---

## ✅ The Unified System

Motia unifies your entire backend into a **unified state**. APIs, background jobs, and AI agents become interconnected Steps with shared state and integrated observability.

| **Before**                  | **After (Motia)**                       |
| --------------------------- | --------------------------------------- |
| Multiple deployment targets | **Single unified deployment**           |
| Fragmented observability    | **End-to-end tracing**                  |
| Language dependent          | **JavaScript, TypeScript, Python, etc** |
| Context-switching overhead  | **Single intuitive model**              |
| Complex error handling      | **Automatic retries & fault tolerance** |

---

## 🔧 Supported Step Types

| Type        | Trigger               | Use Case                              |
| ----------- | --------------------- | ------------------------------------- |
| **`api`**   | HTTP Request          | Expose REST endpoints                 |
| **`event`** | Emitted Topics        | React to internal or external events  |
| **`cron`**  | Scheduled Time (cron) | Automate recurring jobs               |
| **`noop`**  | None                  | Placeholder for manual/external tasks |

---

### 🤔 How it Works

Motia's architecture is built around a single, powerful primitive: the **Step**. A Step is not just a trigger; it's a powerful container for your business logic. You can write anything from a simple database query to a complex AI agent interaction inside a single step. Instead of managing separate services for APIs, background workers, and scheduled tasks, you simply define how your steps are triggered.

-   **Need a public API?** Create an `api` step. This defines a route and handler for HTTP requests. You can build a complete REST or GraphQL API just with these steps.
-   **Need a background job or queue?** Have your `api` step `emit` an event. An `event` step subscribed to that event's topic will pick up the job and process it asynchronously. This is how you handle anything that shouldn't block the main request thread, from sending emails to complex data processing.
-   **Need to run a task on a schedule?** Use a `cron` step. It will trigger automatically based on the schedule you define.

This model means you no longer need to glue together separate frameworks and tools. A single Motia application can replace a stack that might otherwise include **Nest.js** (for APIs), **Temporal** (for workflows), and **Celery/BullMQ** (for background jobs). It's all just steps and events.

## ⚡ Core Concepts

The **Step** is Motia's core primitive. The following concepts are deeply integrated with Steps to help you build powerful, complex, and scalable backends:

### 🔑 Steps & Step Types
Understand the three ways Steps are triggered:
- **HTTP (`api`)** – Build REST/GraphQL endpoints with zero boilerplate.
- **Events (`event`)** – React to internal or external events emitted by other steps.
- **Cron (`cron`)** – Schedule recurring jobs with a familiar cron syntax.

### 📣 Emit & Subscribe (Event-Driven Workflows)
Steps talk to each other by **emitting** and **subscribing** to topics. This decouples producers from consumers and lets you compose complex workflows with simple, declarative code.

### 🏪 State Management
All steps share a unified key-value state store. Every `get`, `set`, and `delete` is automatically traced so you always know when and where your data changed.

### 📊 Structured Logging
Motia provides structured, JSON logs correlated with trace IDs and step names. Search and filter your logs without regex gymnastics.

### 📡 Streams: Real-time Messaging
Push live updates from long-running or asynchronous workflows to clients without polling. Perfect for dashboards, progress indicators, and interactive AI agents.

### 👁️ End-to-End Observability with Traces
Every execution generates a full trace, capturing step timelines, state operations, emits, stream calls, and logs. Visualise everything in the Workbench's Traces UI and debug faster.

## 🚀 Quickstart

Get up and running in **under 60 seconds**:

### 1. Create Your Project

```bash
npx motia@latest create -i
```
- Enter project details like template, project name, etc

### 2. Launch the Workbench

Start the Motia Workbench:

```bash
npx motia dev
# Opens at http://localhost:3000
```


🎉 **That's it!** You now have a fully functional Motia app with:
- ✅ API endpoint at `/hello-world`
- ✅ Visual debugger and flow inspector
- ✅ Built-in observability
- ✅ Hot reload for instant feedback

### 4. Explore the Workbench

The Workbench is your command center for developing and monitoring your Motia application.

- **🌊 Flows**: Visually inspect, design, and understand the connections between your steps.
- **🔌 Endpoints**: Test your API endpoints directly from the UI, with full support for streaming responses.
- **👁️ Traces**: Dive into detailed, end-to-end traces of your workflows. See exactly how data flows, where time is spent, and what errors occurred.
- **📊 Logs**: View structured, correlated logs for every step execution.
- **🏪 States**: Inspect the internal state and data passed between steps for any given workflow execution.
